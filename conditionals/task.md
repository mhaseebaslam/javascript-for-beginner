# Workshop 2: Conditionals

In this task, you will practice the use of conditionals. Follow the instructions given to complete small programming tasks.

## Task 1: Largest Number

Create a simple program in which the user is asked to give two numbers and then your program prints out which one of them is largest.

## Task 2: Largest Number

Extend the program from the previous task to ask for three numbers.

## Task 3: Even or Odd

Write a simple program to figure out whether a given number is even or odd. **Hint!** You can use modulo (%) to achieve this.

## Task 4: Yes or No

Write a simple program that asks the user a simple yes or no question and prints out a corresponding message. Remember to also handle invalid input.

## Task 5: Logical Operators

Write a simple program that asks the user for three numbers and create the following logic:

- If all three numbers are equal print out “You entered three matching numbers”.
- If all three numbers are different print out “You entered three different numbers”.
- If the first two are the same, but the third one is different, print out “Third one doesn’t fit”.
- If any of the numbers is 2, print “You entered the magic number 2!”.

## Task 6: Switch Menu

Create a program with a simple menu and the following functionality:

1. Print hello
2. Print current date
3. End program
Remember to check for invalid input, too. **Hint!** Use switch for this.
