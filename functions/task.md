# Task – Functions

In this Task, you will practice the use of functions. Follow the instructions given to complete small programming tasks.

## Task 1: Letters and Numbers

Create a program with two methods:

1. `printLetters()`: prints letters from a-z
2. `printNumbers()`: prints numbers from 1-9

Call the `printLetters()` method first, then `printNumbers()`, and after that, `printLetters()` again.

**Hint!** To print the letters, you can use Number `toString()` (<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toString>)

## Task 2: Lorem Ipsum

Create a method that prints out the Lorem ipsum sentence ("Lorem Ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.") ten times. Call this method.

## Task 3: Sum of Numbers

Create a program that has a method `sum(firstNumber, secondNumber)` that returns the sum of the numbers passed to the method as input parameters. Call this method, save the return value in a variable, and print it out. Do this three times with different variable values.

## Task 4: Circumference of a Circle

Create a program that calculates the circumference of a circle when the radius is given (circumference = 2 *π* radius). Call this method three times with different parameters and print out the results.

## Task 5: Smileys

Create a program that has the following functionality:

1. Ask the user for a string and store it in a variable.
2. `replaceSmileys(text)`: Finds smileys in text and replaces them with corresponding text as shown in the table below.
3. `replaceSmileysWithReplacer(text, replacer)`: Finds smileys in text and replaces them with replacer. You can use regular expressions (<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp>) for this.

Print out the text.

| Smiley      | Replacement |
|-------------|--------------|
| *smiling*   | smiling      |
| *sad*       | sad          |
| *winkwink*  | winkwink     |
| <3          | love         |
