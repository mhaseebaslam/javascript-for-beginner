# Workshop 3: Loops (while)-(do-while)

In this task, you will practice the use of loops. Follow the instructions given to complete small programming tasks.

## Task 1: Numbers from 0 to 20

Create a code that prints out numbers from 0 to 20. Use a `while` loop.

## Task 2: Numbers from 0 to 20

Create the same functionality but this time use a `do-while` loop.

## Task 3: Looping through Strings

Create a program with the following functionality:

1. Ask the user to enter a string.
2. Loop through the string and print out the string letter by letter saying “1. character is [first letter of given string.]” **Hint!** You might need the following String methods: `charAt()`, `trim()` and property `length`. Check them out in the documentation.

## Task 4: Multiplication Table

Ask the user to enter a number and then print out the corresponding multiplication table using a loop. **Optional:** Try to make the printing according to a specific format. You might use `util.format`, `padStart()` and `padEnd()` to achieve this.

## Task 5: Countdown

Print out numbers from 10 to 0 using a loop.

## Task 6: Palindrome

Ask the user to give a string and then check if it’s a palindrome (a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g., madam or nurses run) or not. Use loops to solve this. **Note:** What happens if "madam" was spelled with a capital letter?

## Tasks for Loops - For

In this workshop, you will practice the use of `for` loops. Follow the instructions given to complete small programming tasks.

## Task 7: Multiplication Tables 2

Print out multiplication tables for numbers 1-10 using a loop. Use nested `for` loops.

## Task 8: Triangle

Create a program that prints a triangle. The program asks the user for the height of the triangle and then prints out a triangle.

## Task 9: Other way around

Create a program that asks the user for a string and then prints it out from the last letter to the first. Use a `for` loop.

## Task 10: toMixedCase()

Create a program that asks the user for a string and then prints it out so that all odd characters are in uppercase and all even characters are in lowercase. Use a `for` loop.
