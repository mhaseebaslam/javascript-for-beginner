# Variables, Operators, Read & Write

In this task you will practice creating and using variables and basic operators. Follow the instructions given to complete small programming tasks.

## Task 1: Number Guessing Game

Create a simple game in which the user has to guess the secret number. The game has the following functionality:

1. Program asks the user to enter a number.
2. Set the secret number to be the entered number plus one.
3. Print out whether the user won or not.

## Task 2: Distance Converter version

Create a simple program that converts distance given in miles to kilometers. Print out the output with basic `write()` and also with `util.format()`.

## Task 3: Distance Converter version

Extend the functionality from the previous task to:

1. Ask for the distance in meters.
2. Also convert the distance to the following units:
   - kilometers
   - miles
   - yards
   - feet
   - inches
   - light years
3. Show numbers with three decimals.

**Hint!** If you want to align the results, you can use `padStart()` function to add empty spaces to make the string equal length. (OPTIONAL)

## 1.4 Task 4: Basic Calculations

Create a simple program with the following functionality:

1. Ask the user to input a number.
2. Define a secret number.
3. Perform and print out basic calculations for that number with the secret number.
